# SimpleHospitalSystem
Simple hospital system is a web application developed by ASP.NET core razer pages with C# to management hospital systems. 
It keeps track of patients information, clinical data, and tracks available beds in each hospital department.

This project was made in a rush for a college project about database system.

# Note
The web application should run on a protected local network in the hospital, and only hospital employees have access to it, as it doesn’t have authentication or authorization. Authentication and authorization along with other features could be implemented, but due to limited time span, they weren’t.
